And this one passed all the tests. I was happy to see that the battery is 100% capacity. And it only had eight cycles when I got it. There was a tiny bit of scratching on the screen, but with the screen protector I put on I can’t even tell. I think I will keep getting Amazon renewed phones from now on.

Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple.

I researched and decided I got the best bang for my buck if I went for the iPhone 15 rather than the iPhone 13. The quality of the unlocked refurbished phone is outstanding. It's just like new except for the packaging. I especially appreciate the much longer battery life as my previous phone I had to recharge constantly during the day. On this one the battery lasts all day. I haven't had the opportunity to use the camera often but it seems there are a few nice options on there.

Thought I’d only get the charger cord but it actually came with the wall plug as well. Phone came 3 days earlier than expected!!! Was a very easy transaction.', 'Received this phone and it was in exceptional shape with 100% battery capability. I was only slightly skeptical based off a few YouTube video reviews but pulled the trigger anyway since my father had received a 14 Pro previously and was happy with his. I was blown away with this one though. It was literally a new phone, it was manufactured September of 2023 and first activated in February of 2024 (happened across this info in the settings at one point), with my purchase and activation being in April 2024. I would imagine that plays a part when making a purchase of a renewed / remanufactured phone, however. Since the 15 series are still relatively new, chances of getting a better phone as compared to a 14 or older is fairly high. I would not change anything on my purchase, and if you are considering getting an older iPhone from the Amazon store, I would suggest getting one from the current generation. Research what model would work best for you and then order that one rather than trying to save money and getting an older model thinking it will simply be cheaper. Features and updates alone make the newer ones worth it, and that’s coming from someone who had an iPhone 4S when they were coming out with the 6, replaced the 4S with a 6 Plus when the 8 was coming out, and just replaced the 8 Plus with the 15 Plus. Food for thought. Newest is not always best, but if you wait and replace your previous iPhone that is multiple generations old, new is a huge step up and I think Amazon renewed is the way to go.', 'Pretty much a brand new phone, battery came at 100% health with cycle count being only 2. Battery lasts shorter than I expected tho, not sure if they replaced the original battery with a fake one or if my expectations were too high because of what I had read. Overall would recommend!']"

Battery life, it all depends on how you use the phone but for every day of my use I've had absolutely incredible battery life, going to work, gym, hangouts and such, this phone lasts me all day! Performance is amazing which is to be expected from Apple, the IPhone's are already smooth be default with their animations, now imagine that with 120hz display... if you know what that is lol. The back of the phone is smooth and if you don't want it slipping then I highly recommend a case. Display is amazing which is no surprise for OLED, I accidentally dropped mine on the corner of my table and thought I killed my phone but it survived without a scratch.

I can say I am happy to be back on iOS. S24 crashed a lot and had cellular issues. This device has had no cellular issues, I can notice it is faster than what my 13 pro was, and with casual use the battery will last two days like the 13 pro.

It's like a brand new phone :)"", 'The iPhone itself seems new, there were no scratches or blemishes as far as I saw. The battery health was 100% so that’s good. Transferring the data and eSIM was simple and I had no issues with that. It also arrived earlier than expected so that’s a plus but now I have to wait for the screen protector and a case to arrive. My only issue is that it could’ve been packaged better. The protective stickers looked like they were just slapped on in a rush and when I took it off there was glue left on the back cameras which I had to spend time cleaning. There’s still some residue left. The second pic shows what the iPhone came in. So far so good overall.

As this fits over the screen it does fit the edges of the iPhone 15. This should really come with the proper screen protector.\n\nOverall, if you want to save some money I would recommend trying this first before buying as new.']"

It\'s a waste of money. Don\'t take my word for it, search Google for iPhone theft & loss scam.\n\nHere\'s the deal: Apple farmed out this plan to the AIG insurance company. They are not a good insurance company (once again, don\'t take my word for it, search AIG is a terrible company and you\'ll get endless stories about the terrible workplace culture, how they helped trigger the great recession, and how they lie/cheat/steal on things like iPhone theft & loss).\n\nWhile there are plenty of stories out there for your reading displeasure, I\'ll recount my daughter\'s - which is identical to thousands of others. She had her phone stolen while out at a bar. She realized within moments that it was gone, so she used another device for Find My Phone and saw that it was already on moving away from her location. She immediately contacted Apple and they told her to follow their recommended steps in case of theft, which includes locking the phone. By the time she finished this, the phone had disappeared (the thief likely turned it off).\n\nThe next day she filed a claim under theft & loss. It was denied because AIG requires that Find My Phone be on for the ""entirety of the claims process."" So, her insurance was ""voided"" by the thief doing what they usually do - turning off the phone so that the actual owner can\'t find it. Same will almost certainly happen if you drop it in a lake or have it run out of juice after being misplaced.\n\nBuying theft & loss coverage from Apple is literally just giving AIG money for something they most likely won\'t honor. Sure, it\'s only a few bucks a month, but if you\'re going to throw money away, do it on something less frustrating.']"

I would rate 5 stars if the charger works. I tired to contact support but they are not very helpful. I don’t understand, this is one of expensive phone but the charger does work? It’s sad.', 'I was skeptical about buying such an expensive, refurbished phone. However, I went against my better judgment and purchased the phone anyway. I purchased the premium renewed phone that was “tested by a specialist!” This specialist must’ve been ready to clock out the day that my phone was tested because this phone is worthless! It’s been on the charger for over an hour and it still will not turn on!  Do not be like me and waste your money! I don’t even want a replacement phone! I’ll be returning this phone tomorrow and will buy a brand new one from the store! Do better Amazon!!!!!', 'They use cheap fake parts that will cause your phone to crash. Since it’s fake parts Apple will not cover it in their hardware warranty.
